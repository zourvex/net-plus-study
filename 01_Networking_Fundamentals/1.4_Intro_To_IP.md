## road analogy
- road is the network connection (like ethernet)
- truck is *internet protocol* 
- TCP and UDP boxes hold your data
- Inside the boxes are application information
### TCP and UDP
- OSI Layer 4 (transport layer)
- *multiplexing* - sending many applications over a network at the same time
- *TCP* 
	- Formal connection set up and close
	- Reliable delivery = avoids out of order messages
	- flow control - receiver can manage how much data is sent
- *UDP*
	- "connectionless" - no formal open or close for session
	- Unreliable delivery = no error recovery/ no retransmissions
- *IP address* tells moving truck where to go
	- *port number* tells movers what room gets what package
