## road analogy
- road is the network connection (like ethernet)
- truck is *internet protocol* 
- TCP and UDP boxes hold your data
- Inside the boxes are application information
### TCP and UDP
- OSI Layer 4 (transport layer)
- *multiplexing* - sending many applications over a network at the same time
- *TCP* 
	- Formal connection set up and close
	- Reliable delivery = avoids out of order messages
	- flow control - receiver can manage how much data is sent
- *UDP*
	- "connectionless" - no formal open or close for session
	- Unreliable delivery = no error recovery/ no retransmissions
- *IP address* tells moving truck where to go
	- *port number* tells movers what room gets what package 
## Ports
- IPv4 sockets - IP address, TCP/UDP, Application port number/client port number
- *non ephemeral ports*
	- ports 0 - 1,023
	- don't really change 
- *ephemeral ports*
	- 1,024 - 65,535
	- usually client-side and more likely to change
- port numbers are just for communication, not security
- service port numbers must be well known 
- TCP and UDP port numbers are not the same
