## FTP - File Transfer Protocol
- generic file transfer method
- not specific to an operating system
- *tcp/20* - file transfer process
- *tcp/21* - control
- full functionality
## SSH - Secure Shell
- text-based console communication
- *tcp/22* - encrypted communication link
## SFTP - Secure FTP
- general file transfer but has security
- uses SSH protocol, therefore they have the same port num: *tcp/22*
- provides file system functionality

## Telnet
- Telecommunication Network
- *tcp/23*
- just like SSH console access but is non-encrypted and in the clear

## SMTP
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol -> used for email
- *tcp/25* - (SMTP using plaintext)
- *tcp/587* - (SMTP using TLS encryption)
## DNS - Domain Name System
- *udp/53* - converts names to IP addresses
- *tcp/53* - may be used for larger transfers

## DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- configures IP address settings for anyone who connects to the network
- *udp/67, udp/68*
- dhcp server can be integrated into a wireless router for home set ups
- DHCP reservation - can make address for a device the same every time
## TFTP - Trivial File Transfer Protocol
- *udp/69*
- simple file transfers, no authentication
- read and write files

## HTTP/s
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- *tcp/80* - HTTP, in the clear
- *tcp/443* - HTTPS, using SSL (encrypted)

## NTP - Network Time Protocol
- *udp/123*
- every device has a clock (switches, firewalls, etc)
- automatic updates and super accurate

## SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol
- *udp/161*
- gathers stats from network devices (how many bytes downloaded this hour?)
- v1 - in the clear, structured tables
- v2 - in the clear, bulk transfers, better data types
- v3 - secure standard, authentication + encryption
