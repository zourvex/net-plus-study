## FTP - File Transfer Protocol
- generic file transfer method
- not specific to an operating system
- *tcp/20* - file transfer process
- *tcp/21* - control
- full functionality
## SSH - Secure Shell
- text-based console communication
- *tcp/22* - encrypted communication link
## SFTP - Secure FTP
- general file transfer but has security
- uses SSH protocol, therefore they have the same port num: *tcp/22*
- provides file system functionality

## Telnet
- Telecommunication Network
- *tcp/23*
- just like SSH console access but is non-encrypted and in the clear

## SMTP
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol -> used for email
- *tcp/25* - (SMTP using plaintext)
- *tcp/587* - (SMTP using TLS encryption)
## DNS - Domain Name System
- *udp/53* - converts names to IP addresses
- *tcp/53* - may be used for larger transfers

## DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- configures IP address settings for anyone who connects to the network
- *udp/67, udp/68*
- dhcp server can be integrated into a wireless router for home set ups
- DHCP reservation - can make address for a device the same every time
## TFTP - Trivial File Transfer Protocol
- *udp/69*
- simple file transfers, no authentication
- read and write files

## HTTP/s
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- *tcp/80* - HTTP, in the clear
- *tcp/443* - HTTPS, using SSL (encrypted)

## NTP - Network Time Protocol
- *udp/123*
- every device has a clock (switches, firewalls, etc)
- automatic updates and super accurate

## SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol
- *udp/161*
- gathers stats from network devices (how many bytes downloaded this hour?)
- v1 - in the clear, structured tables
- v2 - in the clear, bulk transfers, better data types
- v3 - secure standard, authentication + encryption
- SNMP trap - allows notifications to be sent from network devices (ex about data transfers)
	- *udp/162*

## LDAP/ LDAPS - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
- *tcp/389*
- database of devices and users on network
- queries databases to retrieve info
- LDAPS (LDAP over SSL)
	- *tcp/636*
## SMB - Server Message Block
- *tcp/445* - NETBIOS-less
- protocol used by windows
- used for file sharing and printer interactions
- also called *CIFS - Common Internet File System*
- integrated into OS
	- file locking, access rights, file share publishing
##### Netbios
- was used before SMB, basically outdated now
## Syslog
- *udp/514*
- standard for message logging
- integrated into a *SIEM* -> *Security Information and Event Manager*
- uses a lot of disk space

## Databases
- holds many different types of data
- MS-SQL uses *tcp/1433*
	- this is the microsoft version of SQL

## RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol
- shares a desktop or application over a remote location over *tcp/3389*
- used in helpdesk roles

## SIP - Session Initiation Protocol
* *voice over IP (VoIP)* signaling for phones/messaging
* uses *tcp/5060* and *tcp/5061*
* setup and manage VoIP sessions (calling, answering, etc)

# Other Useful Protocols

## ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
- carried by IP
- "texting" for your network devices
- pinging a device uses ICMP
- this is different from tcp/udp because you're not transferring data in the same way
- can tell you TTL

## GRE - Generic Routing Encapsulation
- encapsulates traffic inside of IP
- doesn't include encryption

## VPNs
- encrypted data traversing often used with GRE
- uses a *concentrator* - physical device for encryption/decryption for VPNs
- can be software if there aren't too many users'
- *firewalls* often act as vpn concentrators

## IPSec - Internet Protocol Security
#### OSI Layer 3 security
- Authentication + encryption for each packet
- very common

## IKE - Internet Key Exchange
- creates agreement for encrypt/decrypt keys
	- called a *security association or SA*
### Phase 1
- Uses Diffie-Hellman to create secret key
- *udp/500*
- ISAKMP - Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol
### Phase 2
- coordinates ciphers and key sizes

## Transport Mode and Tunnel Mode
- transport mode doesn't encrypt IP header, but does encrypt the data
- tunnel mode - IP header and data is encrypted
	-  much safer and more common 
## AH - Authentication Header
- validates information being received over tunnel
- all in the clear but with a lil hashing

## ESP - Encapsulation Security Payload

- encrypts the packet and authenticates data
- better than AH
