## Ethernet
- most popular networking technology!
- modern ethernet uses twisted pair copper and fiber optic
- IEEE creates ethernet standards

## Decipher the standard
- name contains speed, signal, media
- *1000BASE-T* - 1000 megabits per second
	- BASE - single frequency using entire medium
		- broadband uses many different frequencies
	- Media type - T is Twisted Copper, F is Fiber

___
# Optical Fiber

## Fiber communication
- transmission by light
- no RF signal means its more secure than copper
- signal is slow to degrade
	- good for long distances
- light is immune to radio interference

## Multimode fiber
- short range comms (2km)
- LED light source
- modes bounce around within fiber

## Single Mode Fiber
- more expensive light source like laser
- better for long range communication
