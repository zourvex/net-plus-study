## Ethernet
- most popular networking technology!
- modern ethernet uses twisted pair copper and fiber optic
- IEEE creates ethernet standards

## Decipher the standard
- name contains speed, signal, media
- *1000BASE-T* - 1000 megabits per second
	- BASE - single frequency using entire medium
		- broadband uses many different frequencies
	- Media type - T is Twisted Copper, F is Fiber

___
# Optical Fiber

## Fiber communication
- transmission by light
- no RF signal means its more secure than copper
- signal is slow to degrade
	- good for long distances
- light is immune to radio interference

## Multimode fiber
- short range comms (2km)
- LED light source
- modes bounce around within fiber

## Single Mode Fiber
- more expensive light source like laser
- better for long range communication

___
# Copper Cabling
- cables are super essential and usually hard to undo and do again

## Twisted pair copper cabling
- two wires with equal + opposite signals
	- ex: transmit+/transmit-
- the two wires help to avoid interference and incorrect signals
- electrical signals are being sent over cable
	- ethernet standards determine how quickly data can be sent over a specific cable
- there are *cable categories* that describes the abilities of a cable and what ethernet standard it supports

## Coaxial Cables
- RG-6 cable used for TV and high speed internet

## Twinaxial Cable
- aka *twinax*
- 10 GB ethernet
- low cost, low latency, but very limited distance (5 meters)

## Plenum space
- space between fake office ceiling and actual ceiling
- this is where cabling infrastructure can be installed
- *no plenum* -> only ducts are used to transfer air
- if there is a plenum and network infrastructure gets too hot, it would spread fumes to the people in the office (yikes)
- make sure to install the right kind of cable

### Plenum-rated cable
- cables covered in PVC, safer in case of fires
- the downside is they are not as flexible for infrastructure with lots of turns
_____
# Transceiver
#### transmitter + receiver
- provides modular interface
- there are different types such as ethernet or fibre channels

## SFP and SFP+
- "Small Form-Factor Pluggable"/ "Enhanced+"
- SFP = 1gb/s
- SFP+ = 10gb/s

## QSFP
- Quad Small Form-Factor pluggable
- 4 channel SFP -> 4GB/s
- QSFP+ -> 40GB/s

___
# Fiber Connectors

## SC - Subscriber Connector
- This is not a real name, SC could mean anything lol
- pushes on to lock
- common in data centers

## LC - Local Connector
- smaller + more compact than SC
- locks into place with a clip

## ST - Straight Tip
- Bayonet connector
- push on and turn, turn to unlock

## MPO - Multi-fiber Push On
- twelve fibers in a single connector
- also called MTP MPO

___
# Copper Connectors

## RJ11 Connector
- *Registered Jack Type 11*
- 6 position, 2 conductor (6P2C)
- telephone and DSL connection

## RJ45 Connector
- 8 position 8 conductor (8P8C)
- used for ethernet (LAN connections) 

## F-Connector
- Coaxial cable
- cable TV infrastructure (screwed into cable modem)
- also called DOCSIS

## BNC Connector
- Bayonet Neill-Concelman
- common coax cable connector
- used for DS3 WAN links, video connections
- twist and lock in place
