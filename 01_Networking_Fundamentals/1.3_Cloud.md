## Virtual Networks
- migrate many physical servers into 1 large server that relies on cloud
## Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
- replacing physical networks with cloud
	- including things such as switches and firewalls
- exact same functionality, everything is just virtual
## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- includes switches, routers, etc
- one company can have many different connected VPCs
- they communicate with each other with a *transit gateway*
	- this is like a "cloud router"
- can use VPN to gain access to VPC
- VPC Gateway/Internet Gateway - internet users can now use the VPC
## VPC NAT
- NAT - Network Address Translation
- VPC Endpoint - allows communication between private virtual machine and cloud storage 
## Network Security List
- list of what IP addresses can communicate with what ports
- This is then applied to the VPC subnets to protect malicious IP addresses from communicating
- they might be too broad (which is annoying)
	- network security group: assign security rule to specific VNICs (individual devices/network connections)
	- much more granularity for defining rules
