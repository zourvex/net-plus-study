- useful for planning new networks and troubleshooting existing ones

## Star / Hub and Spoke
- used in most large and small networks
- all devices are connected to central device
	- central device is a *switch*

## Mesh
- multiple links to the same place
- lots of redundancy and load balancing
- used in Wide Area Networks *WANs*

## Hybrid
- combination of one or more physical topologies
	- most networks are a hybrid of both mesh and star

## Spine and Leaf Architecture
- Switches at the top are the spine
- switches in the middle are the leafs
- switches on the same tier do not connect to each other
	- ex leafs connect to spines, but not other leafs
- Top-of-Rack switching
	- each leaf is on top of a physical network rack
	- simple cabling, redundant, fast
	- however if you have a ton of racks in a data center, it can be expensive to buy so many switches
## Point-to-Point
- one to one connection
- older WAN links and connection between buildings
