## Router

- OSI Layer 3
- Home routers can also come with switches making it several layers
## Switch
- ASIC - Application Specific Integrated Circuit
- OSI Layer 2
## Firewall
- OSI Layer 3 (usually?)
- Filters traffic by port num/ application
## IDS and IPS
- Intrusion detection/prevention
- triggers alert/blocks harmful traffic

## Proxies
- Intercept traffic for safe communication
- cache info 
## NAS vs SAN
- Network Attached Storage
- Storage Area Network (block level so its better)
## Wireless Lan Controller
- Centralized mgmt of access points

## Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- caching servers to make worldwide communication faster
## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- encrypts data on insecure networks
- uses concentrator/ head-end device
	- this is a encryption measure inside a firewall
- VPNs can use hardware if there is a lot of users, or just be software
- sometimes VPN software is built into an OS
## QoS - Quality of Service
- traffic/ packet shaping
- control by bandwidth usage or choose to prioritize certain applications
	- for example: business might prioritize MS word over minecraft server lol
## Time To Live - (TTL)
- creates a timer so device will eventually stop a task
## Internet Protocol -( IP)
- IP drops packet after n hops; router decreases TTL by one each time
	- ex: default hop number for UNIX is 64 before packet is dropped
## Domain Name System - (DNS)
- TTL for DNS is in seconds instead of hops
	- ex: 500 seconds until device throws out the cache
