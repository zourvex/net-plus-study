## Wireless Standards (802.11)
- managed by IEEE - institute of electrical and electronics engineers
- constantly being updated by IEEE
- Wifi Alliance tests interoperability
- Modern standards have easier to remember names like wifi 6

## 4G and LTE
- *LTE* - Long Term Evolution
	- converged standard of GSM and CDMA
	- based on GSM and EDGE - Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution
- LTE Advanced

## 5G 
- introduced in 2020
- significant IoT impact
	- bandwidth is less of a constraint
	- faster monitoring and notification
	- additional cloud processing

## Satellite Networking
- non-terrestrial communication
- speeds are not as fast as traditional networking
- good if there is a remote site that has no other way of communicating 
- high latency (.5 sec)
- if thunderstorm happens, "rain fade" can cause a loss of connectivity in satellite dishes
